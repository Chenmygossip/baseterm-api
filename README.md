# BaseTerm API

A Symfony project created on September 16, 2015, 3:57 pm.

BaseTerm API is an open-source Symfony based API intended to be used by [BaseTerm](https://github.com/byutrg/baseterm). BaseTerm API stores all termbase related information used by BaseTerm. The API can be very picky currently about the kinds of TBX files it will accept. 

This API is similar to the Python based [CRITI API](https://github.com/LexTerm/CRITI/tree/master/server) and either can be used by BaseTerm with minor modifications.


## Installation

BaseTerm API uses Apache, PHP5, and MySQL (it has been tested using Linux, Windows (Wampserver), and Mac(MAMP)).

### Clone Repository

Clone this git repository to the desired directory on your Apache webserver setup.

```
git clone https://github.com/byutrg/baseterm-api.git
```

Enter the directory:

```
cd baseterm-api
```

### Setup MySQL Database and Install Symfony

You will need to create a database for BaseTerm in MySQL along with a user and a password.

Now you must install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).  You can download it from the website or do the following:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --filename=composer
```

Once you have composer in the main directory, you must run it:

```
php composer install
```

This should install Symfony and all other requirements for BaseTerm API.  You will need to provide information about your MySQL instance.  If you do not know yet, these settings can changed later in the app/config/parameters.yml file.

### Prepare the site

From the main directory run the following:

#### Update the database
```
php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

#### Publish

##### Publish to the Development environment
```
php app/console assetic:dump --env=dev
```

##### Publish to the Production environment
```
php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod
```

#### Clear Cache

Note, you may need to fix permissions for the app/cache and app/logs folders after doing this:

```
php app/console cache:clear
```

## Usage

A TBX file may be manually imported into the BaseTerm API by visiting /import.html.  For example, if BaseTerm API is installed at localhost/basterm-api/web, then you can go to localhost/baseterm-api/web/import.html to manually import a file.

## Credits

Special thanks to the Symfony team and all of the developers who have created libraries for it!
